# Synapses

Leaves are thought as connection to hardware, but sometimes it is not enough to connect a sensor and publish its controls and values. A classic example is the need to water a pot at fixed rates or depending on other sensor values (eg. temperature and humidity).

This is where Synapses helps.

Synapses are representing the logic of a board. Scope of those components is to let the user command not only the sensor and actuators, but also the logic of how they behave together. 

# Synapses and leaves

Synapses are currently coded as leaves. They differentiates only on the location, as they resides on `grownode\synapses` folder. All functionalities are completely identical to leaves.
