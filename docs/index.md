
# GrowNode

GrowNode is a vertical framework to build IoT devices targeted to growing plants in a controlled environment. It is currently based on the original work of [Nicola Muratori](https://github.com/ogghst). 

It all started merging the need to keep updated the software development skills, the curiosity for the IOT world, and the idea that technology could help in restoring the connection between urban people and the food.
