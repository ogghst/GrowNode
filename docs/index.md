# Abstract

> GrowNode is a vertical framework to build IoT devices targeted to growing plants in a controlled environment. It is currently based on the work of [Nicola Muratori](https://github.com/ogghst). 

## Target

Grownode is targeted for whoever has the need to build an automatic growing system, from DIY home growing to more advanced farming solutions.

## How GrowNode can help you

This platform will facilitate the hardware and software design and implementation phase, by giving you a ready made set of functionalities, materials and knowledge base. 

## Skills required

In order to startup a basic prebuilt system, you just need to follow the instructions in [boards](boards.md) section.

If you want to play hard and develop your own customized system, a basic knowledge of C programming, ESP-IDF development environment, and electrical engineering is required.

## Examples

### Simple notification system

You can use GrowNode to build a system that warns you when humidity and temperature on a plant is outside determined range, by blinking a LED:

### Network connected system

You can then add network connectivity to a server and have your board warns you on your PC or mobile phone, and change the system parameters via a simple interface.

### Environment controlled system

GrowNode has a growing list of supported sensors and actuators, in order to build a more sophisticated system. You can add sensors, motors, lights, pumps, everything needed to build your own solution customized to your needs.

### Distributed, orchestrated system

Grownode is born having in mind IoT distributed environments. You can add nodes to your system and those nodes will easily talk between each other, acting as a unique orchestrated platform, with no limits over its scalability.
