# Typical Workflow


## Design your application

 - **Define the scope of your project**
 
The first step is to understand what type of system you want to implement. 
Choose among the several possible techniques, and what you want to measure and control.

 - **Sketch your system architecture**

the next step is to define the sensor involved in the system you are designing. You want to perform automatic watering? then you need a water pump. You want to measure water temperature? then you need a temperature probe. Help yourself with a conceptual schema or visit the [solutions](https://github.com/ogghst/GrowNode/tree/master/docs/resources/solutions/hydroboard1) page already made with GrowNode (now it's just my home project :) )

2.	Create your board
a.	Wiring diagram
b.	Bill of Material
3.	Prepare GrowNode sketch
a.	Download base code from github
b.	Configure your project
c.	Assemble using prebuilt leaves 
d.	Create your own leaves
4.	Test it in a breadboard (recommended!) 
5.	Wire it up together
6.	Share your project
